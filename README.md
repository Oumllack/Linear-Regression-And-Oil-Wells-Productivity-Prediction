# Oil Well Productivity Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

## Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive machine learning approach to predict oil well productivity decline. Using advanced algorithms and feature engineering, we developed predictive models that can assist in optimizing well interventions and maximizing hydrocarbon recovery. Our analysis reveals key factors influencing well productivity and provides actionable insights for field operations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

- Bottomhole pressure (psi)
- Water cut (%)
- Productivity Index (PI)
- Cumulative production
- Temporal features (month, year)
- Decline rate
- Water cut trend

### 2.2 Feature Engineering
Advanced feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance model performance:
- Temporal feature extraction
